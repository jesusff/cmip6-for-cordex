      From Figure 5. Model family tree for all 33 CMIP6 models, similar to
      Knutti et al. (2013). Models branching further to the left are more
      dependent, and models branching further to the right are more independent.
      The analysis is based on global, horizontally resolved tasCLIM and
      pslCLIM in the period from 1980 to 2014. Labels with the same color
      indicate models with obvious dependencies, such as shared components
      or the same origin, whereas models with no clear dependencies are
      labeled in black.
      Using this figure 5, we have put in the same family, the GCM lines that merge
      before the dashed line, that correponds to the independence shape
      parameter.
      We have given family names only to families with at least 2 members.
      Note that we are not using the Figure 5 color code to determine the
      family. This leads to some surprise such as 
      Strangely, ACCESS-CM2 is in the same family as UKESM and HadGEM3, but
      not ACCESS-ESM1-5. This was confirmed as ok by the Australian group.
      Also the two FGOALS model are not belonging to the same family with this
      criteria.

      Evaluation of the model using global criteria performance criteria (past trends + spatial pattern)
      Model with performance scores below 0.006 are considered as irrealistic. 
      This study is based on multi-member for each model, not on only one member.
      Wrt to the original article, we consider here only the performance criteria and not the combined criteria that takes
      also into account the independence.
